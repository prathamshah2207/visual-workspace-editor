I have completed work till Part-3 fully and for Part-4 portal creation through ctrl key is possible and it's view in DetailView as well as Miniview is displayed correctly.
The dragging, creation and selection of objects inside of portals is not done well.
So in short the portal display the objects but functionalities like zooming in and out, selection of objects, moving them and creating new ones inside the portal is incomplete.
